    I’ve been at this game for over 10 years, creating User Interfaces for government clients at <a href="https://www.publicissapient.com/industries/public-sector" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Sapient</a> and in the private sector for <a href="https://www.wealthengine.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WealthEngine</a> and <a href="https://www.keycaliber.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">KeyCaliber</a>. I have seen the industry go through a myriad of changes. My experience, grit, and hunger to learn new technologies keep me alert and motivated.

    {
        text: <div><p>Ben worked in my team at WealthEngine. He is a very seasoned UX designer - an all-rounder who knows not only how to design great user experiences with style and usability but also develop full frontend components in React using data. I know very few designers who are full stack like him, skilled in tools like Sketch and Photoshop to HTML, SCSS, JS and React that are needed for creating rich, interactive prototypes. 
        </p><p>
        Ben saved us a ton of lead time by creating reusable style standards and components that developers could directly use in production. 
        </p><p>
        Apart from skills, Ben has honesty, humility and friendliness that make him a gem in the team. I wish him great creative experiences in his future gigs. P.S. Ben’s a great song writer and musician
